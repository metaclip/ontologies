# METACLIP Project overview

The objective of _METAdata for CLImate Products_ (METACLIP) is to encode the metadata required to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of any kind climate product (data files, plots, maps...), thus requiring a comprehensive framework to track the operations undertaken through often complex data workflows. 

The METACLIP ontologies in this repo have been designed as a domain-specific extension of widely used domain-agnostic data models (like PROV) to describe the different activities, agents and transformations involved in climate data product generation, providing domain-specific extensibility of the PROV data model to the climate science context. Furthermore, other data models are also imported in the METACLIP vocabularies (e.g. geosparql, Dublin Core) for the representation of specific climate science features, hence reducing duplicity and promoting interoperability, provided these are based on formal recommendations of working groups widely adopted by the Semantic Web community.
